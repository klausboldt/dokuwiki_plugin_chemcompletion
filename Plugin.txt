    * Plugin created (forked from example projects)

=== Known Bugs and Issues ===

  * A leading zero (05.5) is converted to exponential form (5e+03) with some versions of awk
  * The symbols for molar mass ("M = ") and density ("œÅ = ") that the script inserts are not recognised or interpreted correctly when included in the input

  * The compound name must not include blanks, but underscores are translated to spaces as a work-around
  * No protection of the database file against editing or malicious attack exists
